            <ol>
                <li> Avoid certain color combinations 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Green/red </li>
                        <li> Green/blue </li>
                        <li> Green/black </li>
                        <li> Green/brown </li>
                        <li> Green/gray </li>
                        <li> Light green/yellow </li>
                        <li> Blue/purple </li>
                        <li> Blue/gray </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </br>
                <li> Embrace minimalism 
                    <p> Having many different hues on a site can be confusing and frustrating for individuals who are color blind. </br>
                        In addition to improving your site’s accessibility to those with color deficiency, a minimalist design can also make a site look sleeker and more professional.

            <ol>
                <li> Use grayscale colors/make it monochrome 
                    <p> One of the most definite ways of avoiding issues stemming from color blindness is to employ multiple shades of a single color rather than using multiple colors in the design. </br> 
                        Colors having too similar a hue or having the same temperature are hard to tell apart. Viewing a website in grayscale mode helps envisage how it would appear to a color-blind audience.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </br>
                <li> Use thicker lines 
                    <p> People with a mild case of color blindness are often able to see a color if there’s ample “mass” of it. Therefore, a less than sufficient thin line of color won’t show up as the right color to them. </br> 
                        Even better, it’s more prudent to use texture instead. Especially in infographics and maps, texture can be used in addition to color to distinguish between myriad objects.

            <ol>
                <li> Keep the color palette limited to 2 or 3 colors. </li>
            </br>
                <li> Use high contrast colors 
                    <p> Color blind people are able to perceive differences in brightness, saturation, and hue, as well as contrast. </br>
                        Web designers can leverage this to their advantage, since a plethora of people afflicted with this condition fare better with bright colors than dim ones which have a tendency to blur into one another. </br>
                        For instance, the game Word Feud only uses those colors for its tiles which are easy to distinguish for individuals with color deficiencies.
